# AboutTime
This 'repo is about creating your own time tracking &amp; event logging user interfece, on the 'Web. The web expereince, as well as the internal code design is pretty sexy... even if I do say so, myself ... =)

Note that this project is dedicated to hosting your own web-based (PHP) user interface. Those without their own web site should be aware that an even MORE sexy, classic 'App to run on your Linux / MS Windows Desktops, is also avaialble on Sourceforge @ https://sourceforge.net/projects/abouttime/ .

# Notes
Because PHP projects are usually a nightmare to develop & maintain, in this project we also decided to demonstrate a clean, object-oriented, coding experience. 

This 'Web Project will also be re-written in Python 3... possibly using PEP 3333. 

Until the rewrite, interested parties might enjoy ***Python 3000: Creating and Testing Web Sites.***

(Yes, we can use Python to test PHP - or anything else W3C - as well =)
