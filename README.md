# AboutTime
I believe that happiness in the workplace - as well as elsewhere - is often about doing our best. Giving others a good day's work, for a good day's pay?

Along that same theme, I have also discovered - for most professionals  - that when performance is self-measured, performance improves. 

Others need a more over-the-shoulders approach?

In as much as keeping track of our daily activites is a great way to inspire us to do better, I created both a 'Web, as well as a 'Desktop way to so do.

AboutTime: WEB EDITION
==========
The [AboutTime Web](https://github.com/soft9000/AboutTime/tree/master/AboutTimeWeb02) 'repo is about creating your own time tracking &amp; event logging user interface, on the 'Web. The web expereince, as well as the internal code design is pretty sexy... even if I do say so, myself ... =)

Because PHP projects are usually a nightmare to develop & maintain, in this project we also decided to demonstrate a clean, object-oriented, coding experience. 

AboutTime: DESKTOP EDITION
==========
Those without their own web site should be aware that an even MORE sexy, classic 'App to run on your Linux / MS Windows Desktops, is also available in the [AboutTime Desktop](https://github.com/soft9000/AboutTime/tree/master/AboutTimeDesktop) project folder.

# Notes
This 'Web Project will also be re-written in Python 3... possibly using PEP 3333. 

Until the rewrite, interested parties might enjoy ***Python 3000: Creating and Testing Web Sites.***

(Yes, we can use Python to test PHP - or anything else W3C - as well =)
