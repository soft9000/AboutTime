# AboutTime - Desktop
Having trouble remembering what you did last week? Do you need to create a status report? Surely consultants need to assure clients that they have been earning their pay.

It is amazing how many tasks one can do, yet omit: AboutTime allows us to create meaningful, task-based status reports.

AboutTime also supports troubleshooting & problem detection. By allowing us prioritize, filter, and share log entries, AboutTime can also support "tiger team" troubleshooting operations.

No time to write things down? Relax: AboutTime also has a simple voice-note recording feature. Now we can keep track of what we saw and did, as well as when we first noticed. All real-time data-captured for thoughtful review / annotation later-on.

After awhile, using AboutTime encourages us to do more each day. By encouraging us to do more, AboutTime also allows us to become a lot more productive. Over time, most discover that using AboutTime will help us stand head-and-shoulders above the competition.
