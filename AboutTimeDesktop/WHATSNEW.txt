AboutTime integrates with our command-line `ezlog` logging tool. Change made at the command line are automatically detected by the Desktop App.

What's New:

(1) NEW TRUST-ME MODE
    Log-entry time(s) can now be edited.

(2) NEW WEEK-VIEW MODE
    Weekly entries can be HTML exported, as well as "time-carded."

(3) NEW WEEK-STARTED PARSER
    Start your week on any day. Handy for #2 (above.)

(4) NEW AUTOMATIC SORTING
    Log-files sorted whenever (1) is detected.

(5) CSV & HTLM legacy preserved.

(6) Spreadsheet import / export for spell checking, editing (etc) is fully supported.



Enjoy,
